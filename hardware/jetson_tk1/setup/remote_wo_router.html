		You can login to Jetson TK1 without display and router.<br>
		You can do it by directly connecting your Jetson TK1 to your MS Windows PC with an Ethernet cable.<br>
		In this method, your Windows PC becomes like router by enabling Internet Connection Sharing(ICS).<br>
		This page explains how to enable ICS on Windows 8.1. If you are using different version of Windows, google about how to enable ICS on your windows.<br>
